# Flappy Bird Agent

## Introduction

In this project, the goal is to create an agent that can play the popular game Flappy Bird. The agent will learn to navigate through obstacles and achieve a high score by applying reinforcement learning techniques.
## Game Development

To develop the Flappy Bird game, I followed a tutorial that provided a step-by-step guide on creating the game mechanics. 
This tutorial served as a foundation for building the game environment, including the bird's movement, obstacle generation, and collision detection.

I also utilized the OpenAI Gym framework, which provides a standardized interface for creating and working with reinforcement learning environments. By leveraging the Gym framework, I could easily integrate the Flappy Bird game as a Gym environment, allowing seamless interaction between the agent and the game environment.

## Reinforcement Learning

To train the agent, I will employed reinforcement learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that involves an agent interacting with an environment, learning to make optimal decisions to maximize cumulative rewards.

The agent interacts with the Flappy Bird Gym environment, observing the game state and selecting actions based on its learned policy. It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions, and over time, it adjusts its behavior to achieve higher scores.
